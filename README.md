# nft-preview-card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My task is to build out a preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help complete the challenge. So if I've got something I'd like to practice, I can give it a go.

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

Thanks.
